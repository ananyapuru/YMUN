4. **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is organized into modular components, facilitating easy updates and scalability.
5. **Efficient Data Management:** Algorithms are implemented to accurately and swiftly generate statistics, optimizing decision-making processes.

## Running the Project Locally

For local development and testing, the project leverages MAMP to create a local server environment.

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Install MAMP:** If you haven't already, [download and install MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).
2. **Fork & Clone:** Fork the project repository and then clone it to your local machine.
3. **Set Up Local Server:** Place the application folder into MAMP's `htdocs` directory.
4. **Start MAMP:** Launch the MAMP application and start the server.
5. **Access the Project:** Once the server is running, the application should be accessible at the server endpoint specified in MAMP.

> **Note:** Always ensure you are using the correct server endpoint and port as specified in MAMP's configuration.
